// #include is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the contents of stdio.h (standard input and output) file in the program.
// stdio.h file contains functions such as scanf() and printf() to take input and display output respectively.
// the execution of a C program starts from the main() function.
// return 0; statement is the "Exit status" of the program. In simple terms, the program ends with this statement.
